# MicroSaaS-Mail-Cleanup-Assistant


## Project Description
The Mail Cleanup Assistant is a simple MicroSaaS tool designed to help users manage their email inbox efficiently. It scans emails and suggests bulk-deleting old or unimportant ones based on user-defined criteria. This tool is ideal for individuals who struggle with cluttered inboxes and need a quick way to declutter.

## Features Overview
- Scans emails and identifies old/unimportant messages.
- Allows users to define custom filters for what qualifies as "unimportant" (e.g., older than 6 months, promotional emails).
- Provides suggestions for bulk deletion.
- Streamlit-based user interface for ease of use.
